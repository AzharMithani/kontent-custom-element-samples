# Custom elements' samples overview
## ColorPicker
[ColorPicker](https://github.com/Kentico/custom-element-samples/blob/master/ColorPicker/color-picker.html) is an simple custom element, based on [color-picker](https://github.com/tovic/color-picker) JavaScript library. It allows user to choose a color from palette and sets it as a HEX string, e.g. 'ff0000' for red color, '00ff00' for green and so on. Selected color is being seen as custom element's background. When custom element is disabled, palette is still visible, nevertheless any changes will not be set to custom element's value. Also backgound color is not being changed in this case.
