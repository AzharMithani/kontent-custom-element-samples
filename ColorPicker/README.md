# Color Picker

[ColorPicker](https://github.com/Kentico/custom-element-samples/blob/master/ColorPicker/color-picker.html) is a simple Custom element based on a [color-picker](https://github.com/tovic/color-picker) JavaScript library. It allows user to choose a color from palette and sets it as a HEX string, e.g. '#ff0000' for red color, '#00ff00' for green, and so on. Selected color is then seen as the Custom element's background. When the element is disabled, its color palette is still visible in a content item but does not react when clicked on.

This outputs to:
```json
{
    "color_picker": {
        "type": "custom",
        "name": "Colo Picker",
        "value": "#b93131"
    }
}

```
